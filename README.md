# MiniLisp - Lisp distilled into a lovecraftian

My learning project on "Lisp" interpreter implementation in Rust. Focus on minimal and consistent language design, working interpreter and testing. Non-goals include speed, elegancy, nice error reporting and real-world use cases.

## Stdlib modules
* `logic`: Boolean logic
* `peano`: Peano integers
* `qexpr`: List functions for quoted expressions
